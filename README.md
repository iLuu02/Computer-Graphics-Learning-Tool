# Computer Graphics Learning Tool 🌐

Computer Graphics Learning Tool is a single-page application (SPA) developed using Angular and Three.js. It provides users with an interactive platform to explore various 3D concepts through predefined commands and real-time interactions across multiple scenes. This application is designed for users to learn and experiment with essential 3D graphics principles.

## Main Features ✨
- 🎮 **Real-time interaction** with each scene using mouse controls or commands.
- 🔄 **Geometrical Transformations** including Translation, Scaling, and Rotation.
- 💡 **Lighting Options**: Create, delete, and modify parameters for various light types, including point, ambient, spotlight, and directional.
- 🖼️ **Textures**: Apply textures, bump mapping, and reflection models to enhance visual realism.
- 🌳 **Scene Graphs**: Organize and manage the components of the scene effectively.
- 🔺 **Triangle Mesh**: Utilize triangle mesh for creating complex geometrical shapes.
- 🛠️ **Free Scene Creation**: Create multiple models and lights, interacting with them using all previous features.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Angular**: Web application framework.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript library for 3D graphics.
